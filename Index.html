          <h1>Interest</h1>

          <p>I have been into technology ever since I was little, whether it was building a PC or modding a Playstation I was interested. throughout the years I've always kept up with the latest products and inventions, splurging what little money I could.  When I finished high school I got a job in advertising working on motion design ads, the colleague I worked with was always telling me I need to study as it will help me better my skills for the future. For a while I knew I wanted to study something in IT but wasn't sure which direction to go in, I chose this course as I thought it would give me a broad understanding of lots of different areas in the field and ultimately help choose me a career path.

              <h1>Career</h1>
              <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/39933197?searchrequesttoken=7a976af7-0921-4df1-a8e3-26f5d7ff8fc1&type=standout">Web Developer Advertisment</a>
              <br><br>
              <a data-fancybox="gallery" href="img/job.jpg">Click to View Screenshot of Advertisment</a>
              <p>This job advertisement is calling for a junior web developer who has just graduated or has some experience in the field. The advertisement interests me as it is a junior design position, which will give me the ability to work my way up in the field, learn new skills and build my web development career.
                <br><br>
                The advert says that the employee has to have had prior experience in:
                <br><br>
                HTML
                <br>
                Any Server-Side Languages (PHP, .NET, ASP, Coldfusion, etc...)
                <br>
                JAVA
                <br>
                SQL
                <br>
                JavaScript
                <br>
                JQuery
                <br><br>
                As it stands i have experience in HTML, CSS and very briefly in Javascript, for me to be eligible for this position I will have to better my skills in all the other programming languages.
                <br><br>
                My long-time goal is to build my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript and eventually begin my career in a junior web development position. I plan to absorb as much knowledge as I can in this job and then progress into an app development position. I have worked in multiple jobs throughout my time and I have decided that technology is what im interested in and enjoy doing.

        <h1>Personal Profile</h1>



        <p>Listed below are the graphs from three different personality tests, ‘Learning Styles, Myers-Briggs, and Jungian. Judging the graphs purely on the statistics it would imply that I fit right in the middle between introverted and extroverted and I would personally agree with that, as I do like my own space but also like getting out and meeting new people. Fitting right in the middle between introvert and extrovert means I will fit in good in a group scenario as I will be outgoing and give my ideas but also listen receive feedback, I believe it is a good trait to have when working in groups. <br><br>
        The ‘Learning Styles’ graph shows that I am Kinesthetic learner, meaning I learn more hands-on by doing activities and modules rather than reading or listening to lectures. I completely agree with that statistic as from past experience I have found I learn a lot better by doing practical activities over reading exercises. Overall I think these personality tests have given a pretty accurate example of my learning style and personality type.

              <h1>Project Idea</h1>
              <p>The project idea I have decided to go with is a mobile app that has the ability to pull sources from various different social feeds, the most popular being, Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, etc. Once all the sources have been pulled it would compile all the feeds simultaneously into one large news feed and messaging app. This app would be a ‘one-stop shop’ for an all in one experience which by design saves the user time when surfing their phone also reducing the distraction and hassle of switching between social apps.
                <br><br>
                According to online sources the average user spends 3 to 4 hours a day on their phone, whether its surfing social media or simply just for work purposes, heavy users spanning from 4 to 6 hours per day. This app would attempt to reduce the amount of time spent staring at your screen.
                <br><br>
                By having an app with all your social feeds in one place you could limit your time spent on your mobile each day and enjoy real-life experiences. Both IOS and Android have implemented a new app in their latest software update that monitors the time spent on your device. The app makes it possible to apply self-locking on specific apps that are being overused, this is possible due to the advanced monitoring system these two tech giants have implemented. It seems the latest trend in technology is to try to reduce the use of technology as in 2019 it plays such a big part in our lives. I believe a mobile app that has the ability to be an all in one replacement for the majority of other popular apps on your device is very powerful. Combined with IOS’ “Screen Time” and Google’s “Digital Wellbeing” it would be even easier to reduce screen on time. I can see this app being very appealing to a plethora of demographics, as versions of this app already exist and have received a fair amount of attention and downloads. I feel these apps that already exist don't do my product idea justice and can be produced and advertised in a much more polished manner. The goal I am trying to accomplish.
                <br><br>
                In order to go through with my idea, it will require me to learn a mobile app developing software, most popular programs being, Android Software Development, Swift and Flutter. I would have to do some research into each one of these programs and decide which one will best suit my needs and develop my app idea to its full potential. The tools ill need to run this software would be a Windows or Mac PC and an IOS or Android mobile device for software testing. I believe this is a very achievable product idea, As I have been interested in developing this mobile app long before I started studying ‘Information Technology’ at RMIT.
